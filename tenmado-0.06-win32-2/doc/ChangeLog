	* version 0.6
	* happy birthday, L!
	* happy-L/player-shot.c, libtenm/tenm_table.c: made sure that the

	* happy-L/midnight.c, happy-L/overrun.c, happy-L/disconnection.c,
	  happy-L/fud.c, happy-L/last-boss.c: don't modify my->attr or
	  my->hit_mask in my->hit(), or the player shot may fly through
	  the enemy
	* Makefile.am, README-ja-sjis: added \r before each \n
	* Makefile.am, happy-L/Makefile.am, libtenm/Makefile.am: added
	  -Wno-long-long to CC_WARNINGS

	* happy-L/explosion.c: int/double consistency in the initial value
	* happy-L/normal-enemy.c: don't decrement the "no escape" timer
	  if it is not positive
	* happy-L/disconnection.c, happy-L/fud.c: a dead enemy has low
	  priority when we draw the window
	* happy-L/explosion.c: explosion has low priority when we draw
	  the window
	* libtenm/tenm_table.c: added sanity check to
	  tenm_table_detect_collision() to handle hit() of an object that
	  deletes the object which collides with it

	  happy-L/result.h, INSTALL, libbac/bac_dump.h, libbac/bac_entry.h,
	  save/Makefile.am, util.c: added (dangerous) --without-posix support
	* score.c: reset extend_next whenever a game starts
	* happy-L/intuition.c, happy-L/laser.c, happy-L/normal-shot.c:
	  an enemy shoots at a random direction if it aims at you and if it
	  and you are at the exacely same point
	* happy-L/midnight.c: don't call midnight_bit_signal_to_bit() if
	  the bit is already dead

	  happy-L/stage-clear.c, happy-L/title.c, hit-status.c,
	  libbac/bac_entry.c, libbac/bac_entry_to_string.c, score.c, ship.c:
	  s/snprintf/sprintf/g because snprintf is a GNU extension

2003-01-04  Oohara Yuuma  <oohara@libra.interq.or.jp>

	* version 0.4
	* configure.ac: recongizes libdb-3 as well as libdb3 (thanks to
	  shinichiro.h <g940455@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp> for the bug report)
	* README, happy-L/result.c, loop.c, option.c, option.h, tenmado.6:
	  added --slow option
	* README, main.c, option.c, option.h, tenmado.6:
	  added --help and --version options
	* libtenm/tenm_collision.c: fixed the "circle assumption" in
	  tenm_collided_point_polygon() and tenm_collided_segment_segment2()
	  (the radius should be 0.5, not 1)
	* libtenm/tenm_graphic.c, libtenm/tenm_graphic.h: implemented
	  the Bresenham algorithm for drawing a circle or a line (warning:
	  these drawing functions contain toxic waste --- they're not pure
	  Bresenham since I need a wide line)
	* happy-L/intuition.c, happy-L/last-boss.c, happy-L/normal-shot.c,
	  happy-L/solution.c: enemy shots are more distinguishable
	* happy-L/player.c, happy-L/image/player-blue.png,
	  happy-L/image/player-purple.png, happy-L/image/player-red.png:
	  your weak point is more distinguishable (the sprites are too
	  unrealistic, but this is a shoot-em-up, not a flight simulator)
	* libtenm/tenm_graphic.c, libtenm/tenm_primitive.c,
	  libtenm/tenm_primitive.h, libtenm/tenm_collision.c,
	  libbac/bac_entry.h, libbac/bac_entry.c,
	  libbac/bac_entry_to_string.c, libbac/bac_save.c, util.c:
	  s/class/klass/ in favor of Python (not for C++ --- the headers
	  don't have the extern "C" line, and I use "new" and "delete"
	  as part of a function name)
	* INSTALL: fixed the binary permission in the high score file example
	  (the binary has no need to be group-writable)
	* libbac/bac_lexical.l: fixed the line number in an error message
	* score.c: code cleanup
	* libbac/Makefile.am: added -8 to AM_LFLAGS just in case
	* Makefile.am, happy-L/Makefile.am, libbac/Makefile.am,
	  libtenm/Makefile.am: dropped -Wtraditional from CC_WARNINGS
	  (I use string concatenation) and added -Wconversion
	* happy-L/disconnection.c, happy-L/ending.c, happy-L/explosion.c,
	  happy-L/fud.c, happy-L/high-score.c, happy-L/intuition.c,
	  happy-L/laser.c, happy-L/last-boss.c, happy-L/message.c,
	  happy-L/midnight.c, happy-L/normal-enemy.c, happy-L/overrun.c,
	  happy-L/result.c, happy-L/solution.c, happy-L/stage-1.c,
	  happy-L/stage-2.c, happy-L/stage-3.c, happy-L/stage-5.c,
	  happy-L/stage-clear.c, happy-L/title.c, libbac/bac_entry.c,
	  libbac/bac_entry_to_string.c, libbac/bac_load.c,
	  libbac/bac_truncate.c, libtenm/tenm_graphic.c, chain.c,
	  hit-status.c, score.c, ship.c:
	  integer/floating point and signed/unsigned consistency
	  (by using explicit cast)
	* libbac/bac_entry_to_string.c: free unused memory
	* COPYING: removed because this is same as GPL-2
	* const.h: added COPYRIGHT_STRING
	* LICENSE, happy-L/title.c: updated copyright year
	* happy-L/default/score-*: updated
	* TODO: updated

2002-12-21  Oohara Yuuma  <oohara@libra.interq.or.jp>

	* libbac/*, happy-L/high-score.c, happy-L/high-score.h: new files,
	  handling high score files

	  added high score file support
	* option.c, option.h: new files, handling command line options
	* loop.c, main.c: added command line option support
	* libtenm/tenm_graphic.c, libtenm/tenm_graphic.h: added fullscreen
	  support

	* libtenm/tenm_graphic.c, libtenm/tenm_graphic.h, main.c: fixed
	  hardcoding the window name in a libtenm function
	* README: minor editorial fix
	* happy-L/title.c: fixed a typo in an error message
	* happy-L/image/font-medium.png: fixed underscore

	  contact information and some history
	* happy-L/image/Makefile.am, happy-L/image.c, util.c: install
	  image files in $(datadir)/games/tenmado/image/ instead of
	  $(datadir)/games/tenmado/
	* loop.c: "average fps" message is sent to stdout instead of stderr
	* Makefile.am cleanups
	  - uses some AM_ variables
	  - removed CC_OPTIMIZE because -g -O2 are in CFLAGS and I use
	    AM_CFLAGS
	  - don't use LDFLAGS for .a
	  - use install-data-local instead of install-exec-local
	    for image files
	  - added AMTAR=ustar because GNU tar is not conforming to Posix
	* TODO: updated

2002-11-26  Oohara Yuuma  <oohara@libra.interq.or.jp>
