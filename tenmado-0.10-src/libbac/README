libbac --- high score file library
$Id: README,v 1.7 2003/01/15 22:44:05 oohara Exp $

Files in this directory are for handling a high score file.
You need Berkeley DB version 3 (libdb3) to build these files.
You need aotuconf, automake, flex and bison in addition
to hack these files.

The parser assumes that NEWLINE (\n) and TAB (\t) are not printable.
It checks them by isprint(), so it may fail to work under some locale.

BAC are the initials one of my acquaintance (aka shumagorath II) uses
when he enters his name in an arcade game.  I don't know his real name.
