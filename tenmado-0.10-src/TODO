tenmado TODO list
$Id: TODO,v 1.5 2003/01/07 18:28:34 oohara Exp $

* better graphic (I'm not an artist, good image files wanted)
* sound/music (explosion sound is a must for a shoot 'em up)
* better error handling (check the return value of functions, more
  error message)
* more documentation/comment
* split libbac/libtenm
* swig interface to libbac/libtenm
* add mouse support to libtenm (so that icbm3d can be ported to libtenm)
* fix memory leaks (they are in getpwuid(), yylex or SDL --- I don't know
  how to fix them)
